Space Strategy Game

The objective of this game is to protect your command ship from the endless waves 
of increasingly difficult enemies coming from the right of the screen.
To help you with your task you have a few ships you can deploy from your arsenal
Be careful though as each ship requires some of your command points (Pink/Gray bar at the top of the screen)

You move THEN attack! Use this to your advantage to gain one on the enemy and strike before they can react!
